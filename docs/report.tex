\section*{Data}

Our data is generated from a Prolog program. We use a given maximum depth and a
small set of operations to produce all possible programs which do not produce
unbound variable errors. Each program is stored as one line in a text file. We
then give this file as input to an interpreter, which evaluates each file and
produces the output of the program and the type of error. This can be processed
by Python and fed into a Tensorflow or Keras network.

\section*{Network}

Our best results so far is from a neural network with a 256 LSTM layer, a 0.2
dropout layer, and 128-64-16-1 dense layers with RELU activation functions. This
was trained with 100 epochs (stopped at 58 with early stopping) with a 100 batch
size of 500.

\section*{Results}

Our final accuracy was 0.776 using output prediction and our error prediction
accuracy was 0.969. Below are several sample outputs.

\subsection*{Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
tests = tokenize(np.array(['(+ 1 1)',
                           '((lambda) (x) (+ x 1)) 1)',
                           '(/ 1 2)',
                           '(* 2 (* 2 2))',
                           '(* 2 2)',
                           '(* 1 (+ 2 1))',
\end{lstlisting}
